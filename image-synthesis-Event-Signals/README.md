# Image Synthesis repository with Event Signals component
Original repository for ML-ImageSynthesis can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/ml-imagesynthesis/src/master/)

## Event Signals
A Unity component for Camera objects. Only those pixels whose absolute difference between frames pass a threshold are shown, thus simulating data that could be generated from a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS).  

Found in Assets/EventSignals

Note that this component is not integral to the project as a whole, as [DAVIS simulator](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_davis_simulator) can be used to obtain a simulated DVS dataset
